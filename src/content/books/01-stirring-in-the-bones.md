<p class="text-center italic mt-5">"A personal story at the heart of a vast, fragile universe."<br> – Tara Lindsey, author of "The Esbat Sequence"</p>

<p class="text-center italic mt-5">"This book was full of mystical science fiction! Jennifer created a beautiful world full of characters you will love and an ethereal ambiance you won't want to leave behind!"<br> – Erin DeMoss</p>

Elys Ki Dul long ago accepted that he is neither the best nor brightest of the Hantirri Order. He takes comfort in being useful, focusing on completing his missions as a courier and training the apprentice he chose himself, despite her unconventional nature.

When an unexpected letter comes into his possession, he finds himself charged with a task meant for those more powerful than himself. With his world turned upside down, Elys relies on his apprentice's clear-headed outlook, a new companion's heart-centered strength, and the wisdom of a mysterious old woman who is more than she seems.

Set amidst a galaxy recovering from centuries of conflict, A Stirring in the Bones tells the story of a humble man forced to question his place in the universe when Fate comes calling. Or maybe he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Even Elys isn't quite sure.
