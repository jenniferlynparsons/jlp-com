This is a book plucked out of time. It has always been there. You have always known it. In your quiet moments. When the wind and the sky are just so. Tales (and a poem!) of old gods and older truths, of subtle adventure, of love and cooking and, of course, walking.

This is a book of memory, and it's calling you home.
