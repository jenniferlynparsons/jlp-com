I've put a new book out today and I'm genuinely proud of having my name on it. It's called "All Is Hell Bent" and it's my take on the story of Loki from the viewpoint of his wife Sigyn. She rarely gets much attention in the Norse myths, so I've chosen to give her a voice here, to see this old tale through her eyes. 

## The core question that pulled me in
What would make the goddess of Constancy hitch her wagon to the mercurial Trickster as he spiraled toward Ragnarok? That was the question in my head when I did a deep dive into these myths over a decade ago now. Why would she put up with his shit? Could it maybe, possibly, have been love? I thought so, but how did it all play out? How did they end up in the dark cave together at the end of all things?

It was a powerful enough idea that I sat down and wrote a novella about their story, their love, and the tragedy of their family. I was utterly swept away in writing it, one of those special times a writer sits back and wonders where the work came from because surely it can't be mine. (and no, I don't mean in the AI way) But I did write it and I'm immensely proud of it.

As I was putting the book together, I also gathered a few poems, a short story, and some meditations (patterned after Rilke's Book of Hours) all Loki-related from that time I spent in deep exploration, hence the book's subtitle "And Other Dispatches From Asgard".

## What's the book like?
To give you a sense of it, if you loved "The Witch's Heart" by Genevieve Gornichec or "Circe" by Madeline Miller, you will probably enjoy this, too. If you'd like to learn a bit more about it, I'll be posting a few things here on the site this week.
