I've had a story published in a wonderful anthology and have a book forthcoming this winter!

My story "Dumb Supper" which is based on the pagan concept of a meal to honor the ancestors, can be found in [The Shining Cities](https://www.amazon.com/Shining-Cities-Anthology-Science-Fiction/dp/1479228923) from Bibliotheca Alexandrina.


My next book will be coming out this winter as well. Title to be announced soon! It's a very different concept and format than my last novel and I look forward to sharing it with the world.
