In case I didn’t mention it in my last post (I think I did) I am now [running a small press](http://lunastationpress.com). I highly recommend such a course of action only for those with the ability to roll with the punches, because damn-o, this is a lot of work. It’s definitely not about getting to read books or stories, because that is only a small percentage of what goes on. Fortunately, I had no such delusions when I started, so I’m doing just fine.

However, that is not the reason I’m type, type, typing away here. No, I’m writing this because I sold a story. Yay! I have a tale called “The Dumb Supper” coming out in Bibliotheca Alexandrina’s [“The Shining Cities”](https://www.amazon.com/Shining-Cities-Anthology-Science-Fiction/dp/1479228923) anthology which should be out sometime in September. (UPDATE: It's available!)

And there’s more! The lovely Rebecca Buchanan, editor of that self-same publisher and also editor of [Eternal Haunted Summer](http://eternalhauntedsummer.com/), has asked for an interview! I’m humbled and honored, and yes, of course I’ll be posting a link when it goes live in her next issue.

And for now that’s all the news that’s fit to print. Whenever I next update, there will definitely be some news about my next book and you have no idea how much it thrills me to say that there will definitely be one, for certain.
