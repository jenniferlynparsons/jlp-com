I’m excited about a few things I’m adding to the site over the next week or so.

First off, I’ve already added a link to my latest project. [Storyteller Tools](http://www.delicious.com/storytellertools) is something I’ve wanted to do for some time now. It was meant to be more complex, but in the end, simplicity won out. It is nothing more or less than a Delicious account devoted to the best writing and worldbuilding resources I can get my hands on. It is still a work in progress as I gather links scattered across my various browsers and bookmarking tools. Please do send me any links that might be helpful to your fellow writers!

And secondly, I’ve decided to go ahead and post a short novel I wrote some time ago. I’m going to do it under a Creative Commons license, so it will be free for anyone to read. I will admit right up front that it is a mixed bag of quality, a bit cliched and not the most original thing on the block. Still, it has its moments and in looking it over, I still have an affection for the characters. Stay tuned for more details.

Finally, I’d like to announce that [Luna Station Quarterly](http://lunastationquarterly.com) is now accepting submissions for our first annual drabble issue. 100 words of genre awesomeness, take the challenge if you dare!
