NaNoWriMo was a bust, but then you knew that, right? I knew going in it was not going to be a full-on effort and that’s okay. I did actually manage to get a fair amount of words down.

The reason for my extended absence, though, was not that I was wallowing in a pit of despair having failed to meet that November 30th deadline. No, instead I became gainfully and full-time employed once more and the period of adjustment back to the working world was a bit longer than expected.

So, I am now revving up the writing machine again and I’m ready to see what comes out next.

I’ll be posting a few more stories up here, having published in Dark Valentine Magazine and Eternal Haunted Summer in the recent interim. I’m proud of both works and pleased as punch that they were seen by a larger audience. I highly recommend both publications, they publish stellar work.

I’m also looking forward to getting more of my work out into the world. Towards that end, I’ll be editing more of the 52 short stories I wrote last year and sending them off. I’m also working on a number of essays, mostly on web design, that I’ll be publishing online and reposting here as well.

And I’ll be sure to keep you all updated here on a more regular basis in the future.
