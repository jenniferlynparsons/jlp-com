Just got news that one of my stories has been accepted for [Eclectic Flash](http://www.eclecticflash.com/)â€˜s September issue! Iâ€™m very pleased, needless to say, and I encourage you to check their site out and read the archives while you wait around for my story. ðŸ˜›

UPDATE 2025: Unfortunately eclectic flash and it's archives are no longer available. :(
