Damn, I am really excited to put this book out.

Smooth production from start to finish, it’s in a neat small format, with the pretty and smooth matte finish that I love. But that’s just the physical details.

I’m proud of the stories and format of this book. It’s got a way of weaving through the Astyrred that lets a reader jump in pretty much anywhere, and stop whenever they need to. It’s a great book to have on hand for little spare reading moments. It’s also been described like this:

“An improbable, non-linear romp through an imagined universe, as snappy as Kerouac’s drives with Dean Moriarty. All sci-fi should swing this much. Damn, I wish I wrote this book!” – *Tara Lindsey, Author of “The Esbat Sequence”*

Who wouldn’t swoon if their book was described like that. Thank you, Tara!

Here’s the more official description, for those who want to know what the book is actually about:

*Pious knights protect the pilgrim road, bandits hide in deserted corners of space, creatures more than human plot the downfall of the Orders, and the ordinary people do what they must to simply survive. And then there is the dark rumor of a ghost on Uitat, in a fortress long ago abandoned.*

*Moving through space and across timelines, the wandering nature of this volume invites you to explore a complex galaxy at war and to see it through the eyes of those that dwell there.*

So, if that all wet your whistle, then you can [GO HERE](http://www.lunastationpress.com/book/castles-starships/) and learn how to buy a copy.
