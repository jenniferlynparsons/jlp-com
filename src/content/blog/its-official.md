Iâ€™m a NaNoWriMo Rebel.

I started working on a story this afternoon. Iâ€™m going to keep going with it and whatever word count I get during NaNo will be my wordcount. Iâ€™ve won twice, Iâ€™ve proven I can do it. After a bit of time off, I just want to be involved again and tap into the energy and enthusiasm that group produces.

If for some reason I finish the story (not likely, but with two weeks to go before it starts, who knows) then Iâ€™ll get back to my unfinished shorts and work on those. In the end, if by some fluke I manage to make 50k, you can bet your ass Iâ€™m downloading that certificate!

So there we go. Now I have an excuse to make NaNoWriMo icons and things and go on the forums. ðŸ˜›
