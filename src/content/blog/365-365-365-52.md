It’s done. It’s really, really done. Since this date last year, I have read 365 short stories, 365 poems, and 365 essays. I’ve also written 52 short stories (plus a couple drabbles, a poem or two, and some spare bits of story fodder).

Holy Shit.

So. Tomorrow I start reading ‘Chalice’ by Robin McKinely in an effort to retrain my brain towards reading longer fiction again and start letting my brain relax and reassess where I am in my writing and where I want to go next. Lots of editing to do, of course, but what else?

There’s plenty of writing exercises I can work through, and I can start getting story ideas down as well. Most importantly, though, is that I keep reading. If you don’t have enough time to read, you don’t have enough time to write, so read on, I will.
