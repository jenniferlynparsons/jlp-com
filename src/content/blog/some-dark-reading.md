Hello, my dears!

I wanted to let you all know that my story “Black as Hell” has been published by Dark Valentine Magazine. You can read it [here](http://darkvalentine.net/index.php/2010/10/fall-fiction-frenzy-5/). Take note of the beautiful artwork by Pamela Jaworska. It’s perfect!

I highly encourage you to go read the rest of the stories being posted this month as part of their Fall Fiction Frenzy. Some great stuff by some talented writers.

I also want to encourage any other writers out there to come on over to [Luna Station Quarterly’s October Writing Challenge](http://lunastationquarterly.tumblr.com/). All are welcome to join in (yes, the boys can come, too!) and it’s never too late to start! Details are available [here](http://lunastationquarterly.tumblr.com/post/1193591472/the-first-annual-halloween-challenge).
